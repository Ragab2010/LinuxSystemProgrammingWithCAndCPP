Sure, I'll guide you through the steps to create object files, archive them into a static library, and then use that library in a C program. I'll also explain the relevant flags for the compiler and linker.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Compile the `.c` Files into Object Files

You need to compile `myadd.c`, `mydiv.c`, `mymul.c`, and `mysub.c` into object files (`.o` files).

```bash
gcc -c myadd.c -o myadd.o
gcc -c mydiv.c -o mydiv.o
gcc -c mymul.c -o mymul.o
gcc -c mysub.c -o mysub.o
```

- `gcc`: This is the GNU Compiler Collection command.
- `-c`: This flag tells GCC to compile the source files into object files, but not to link them into an executable.
- `myadd.c`, `mydiv.c`, `mymul.c`, `mysub.c`: Source files.
- `-o`: Specifies the output file name (e.g., `myadd.o`).

#### 2. Create the Static Library Using `ar`

The `ar` command is used to create, modify, and extract from archives (which can be static libraries in this case).

```bash
ar rcs libmymath.a myadd.o mydiv.o mymul.o mysub.o
```

- `ar`: The command to create and manage archives.
- `rcs`: Flags used with `ar`:
  - `r`: Replace or add files to the archive.
  - `c`: Create the archive if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
  - `s`: Write an index to the archive (for faster access to individual members).
- `libmymath.a`: The name of the static library file.
- `myadd.o`, `mydiv.o`, `mymul.o`, `mysub.o`: The object files to be included in the library.

#### 3. Use the Static Library in Your Driver Program

You need to compile `prog1.c` with `mymath.h` and link it against `libmymath.a`. You should include the path to `mymath.h` and the static library in the compile command.

Change directory to `driver` and run:

```bash
gcc -I../ -o prog1 prog1.c -L../ -lmymath
```

- `gcc`: The GNU Compiler Collection command.
- `-I../`: Adds the parent directory (`..`) to the list of directories to be searched for header files.
- `-o prog1`: Specifies the name of the output executable.
- `prog1.c`: The source file for the driver program.
- `-L../`: Adds the parent directory to the list of directories to be searched for libraries.
- `-lmymath`: Links the program with `libmymath.a`. The `-l` flag is followed by the name of the library without the `lib` prefix and `.a` suffix.

### Summary of Compiler and Linker Flags

1. **Compiler Flags:**
   - `-c`: Compile source files into object files without linking.
   - `-I`: Specifies the directory where header files are located.

2. **Linker Flags:**
   - `-L`: Specifies the directory where the linker should search for libraries.
   - `-l`: Links against a library. You provide the name of the library without the `lib` prefix and the `.a` suffix.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Compile source files into object files
gcc -c myadd.c -o myadd.o
gcc -c mydiv.c -o mydiv.o
gcc -c mymul.c -o mymul.o
gcc -c mysub.c -o mysub.o

# Create the static library
ar rcs libmymath.a myadd.o mydiv.o mymul.o mysub.o

# Compile and link the driver program
cd driver
gcc -I../ -o prog1 prog1.c -L../ -lmymath
```

Following these steps should allow you to compile your C source files into object files, create a static library, and then use that library in a driver program. Let me know if you have any more questions!
